# --- Call your test scripts below ---

# The README suggests adding test scripts to the tools/util/ directory
# and calling them from here.

# Example: Run all python test scripts in tools/util/
# for test_file in tools/util/test_*.py; do
#     if [ -f "$test_file" ]; then
#         echo "Running test: $test_file"
#         python3 "$test_file"
#         if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
#             echo "Test failed: $test_file"
#             exit 1
#         fi
#     fi
# done

# Example: Run a specific test script for a Node.js project
# npm test

echo "Test script finished successfully."

# The script should exit with a non-zero status code if any test fails.

exit 0
