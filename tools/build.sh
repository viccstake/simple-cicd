# --- Add your build commands below ---

# This script should contain the commands necessary to compile or prepare your code for testing and deployment.

# Example for a Python project:
# echo "Installing dependencies..."
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Example for a Node.js project:
# echo "Installing dependencies..."
# npm install
# echo "Building production assets..."
# npm run build

# Example for a compiled language (e.g., Go):
# echo "Compiling the application..."
# go build -o myapp ./cmd/myapp

echo "Build script finished successfully."

# The script should exit with a non-zero status code if the build fails.
# Most commands will do this automatically.
